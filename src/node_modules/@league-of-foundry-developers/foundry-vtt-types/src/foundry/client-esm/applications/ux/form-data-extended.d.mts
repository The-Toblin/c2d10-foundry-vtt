/**
 * An extension of the native FormData implementation.
 *
 * This class functions the same way that the default FormData does, but it is more opinionated about how
 * input fields of certain types should be evaluated and handled.
 *
 * It also adds support for certain Foundry VTT specific concepts including:
 *  Support for defined data types and type conversion
 *  Support for TinyMCE editors
 *  Support for editable HTML elements
 * @remarks TODO: Stub, copy from v12 implementation & update
