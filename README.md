A repository for the second edition of the CD10 Roleplaying System module for Foundry VTT.

DISCLAIMER:
This is public, but in no way in any shape or form in release territory. This is extremely alpha, very in-dev and breakage is a guarantee. If you install this system, expect broken-ness. Releases will be added to Foundry when it's considered somewhat stable.
